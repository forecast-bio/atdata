# Issue #486: Separate benchmark groups by timescale in justfile

**Priority:** medium
**Status:** open -> CLOSED
**Created:** 2026-01-30

## History

This issue requested separating benchmark groups in the justfile by their expected timescale, so fast benchmarks (serialization, microsecond scale) are separated from slower ones (I/O, S3, millisecond+ scale).

## Current State Assessment

The justfile has five separate benchmark commands, each with its own pytest marker and JSON output file:

- `bench-serial` -- Serialization benchmarks (microsecond scale)
- `bench-index` -- Index provider benchmarks (microsecond-millisecond scale)
- `bench-io` -- Dataset I/O benchmarks (millisecond scale)
- `bench-query` -- Query system benchmarks (millisecond scale)
- `bench-s3` -- S3 storage benchmarks (millisecond+ scale)

The `benchmarks/render_report.py` labels each group with its timescale in the report output:
```python
"bench_serial": "Serialization (us scale)",
"bench_index": "Index Providers (us-ms scale)",
"bench_io": "Dataset I/O (ms scale)",
"bench_query": "Query System (ms scale)",
"bench_s3": "S3 Storage (ms+ scale)",
```

The `bench` command runs them all sequentially, each writing to a separate `.benchmarks/<group>.json` file.

## Decision

**CLOSE** -- Benchmarks are fully separated by timescale with labeled groups.
