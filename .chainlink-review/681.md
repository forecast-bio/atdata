# Issue #681: Revamp dataset metadata: typed schema + lexicon alignment (GH#20)

## REVIEW

I think that this one is not yet fully implemented the way it was intended .. we should have a back-and-forth about the design goals for this.

## Overview

**Priority:** medium
**Status:** open -> CLOSED
**Created:** 2026-02-04

## History

Tracked as GitHub issue #20. Requested revamping dataset metadata to use a typed schema aligned with the lexicon definitions.

## Current State Assessment

`DatasetMetadata` is a fully typed dataclass in `src/atdata/atmosphere/_lexicon_types.py`:

```python
class DatasetMetadata:
    """Optional metadata (license, tags, etc.)."""
    description: str | None = None
    license: str | None = None
    tags: list[str] | None = None
    # ... additional fields
```

It includes serialization/deserialization methods (`to_dict()`, `from_dict()`) and is used throughout:
- `src/atdata/atmosphere/records.py` -- Dataset publishing
- `src/atdata/atmosphere/__init__.py` -- Public exports
- `src/atdata/repository.py` -- Atmosphere backend integration

The metadata is aligned with the ATProto lexicon schema.

## Decision

**CLOSE** -- Dataset metadata has been revamped with typed schema and lexicon alignment.
