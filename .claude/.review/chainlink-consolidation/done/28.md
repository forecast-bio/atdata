# Issue #28: Implement dataset index record publishing

## Verdict: CLOSE

## Evidence
`DatasetPublisher` provides complete dataset record publishing with all storage variants. It supports four publishing methods: `publish()` for existing Datasets with auto-schema publishing, `publish_with_urls()` for explicit HTTP shard URLs, `publish_with_s3()` for S3 storage with bucket/region/endpoint, `publish_with_blobs()` for inline blob upload, and `publish_with_blob_refs()` for pre-uploaded blob references. All methods support per-shard checksums, structured metadata, tags, license, and description. `DatasetLoader` provides get, list, typed access, storage type detection, URL extraction, S3 info, blob URL resolution, and metadata decoding with legacy msgpack backward compatibility. `to_dataset()` creates Dataset objects from ATProto records.
