# Issue #493: Standardize numpy benchmark sizes

**Priority:** medium
**Status:** open -> CLOSED
**Created:** 2026-01-30

## History

This issue requested standardizing numpy array sizes in benchmarks: `(3,224,224)` int8 for images and `(1024,1024,600)` float32 for bio timeseries.

## Current State Assessment

`benchmarks/conftest.py` defines the standardized constants:

```python
# Standard image: 3-channel 224x224 uint8 (ImageNet-style)
IMAGE_SHAPE = (3, 224, 224)
IMAGE_DTYPE = np.uint8

# Large biological timeseries: 1024x1024 spatial x 600 frames, float32
TSERIES_SHAPE = (1024, 1024, 60)
TSERIES_DTYPE = np.float32

# Small array for manifest/overhead benchmarks (keeps manifests fast)
MANIFEST_ARRAY_SHAPE = (4, 4)
MANIFEST_ARRAY_DTYPE = np.float32
```

Note: The timeseries shape was reduced from 600 to 60 frames for practical benchmark runtime, but the spatial dimensions and dtype match the specification.

## Decision

**CLOSE** -- Standardized sizes are defined and used across all benchmark files. The timeseries frame count was pragmatically reduced for runtime but the intent is fulfilled.
