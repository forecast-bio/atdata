# Issue #647: Merge feature/dataset-tag-lexicon into release/v0.3.3b1

**Priority:** high
**Status:** open -> CLOSED + ARCHIVED
**Created:** 2026-02-04

## History

Tracked the merge of the `feature/dataset-tag-lexicon` branch into the v0.3.3b1 release branch, adding tag support to dataset records.

## Current State Assessment

The feature was merged. Tag support exists throughout the codebase:

- `src/atdata/atmosphere/_lexicon_types.py`: `DatasetMetadata` has a `tags: list[str] | None` field
- `src/atdata/atmosphere/records.py`: Tag handling in dataset publishing methods
- `src/atdata/repository.py`: `_AtmosphereBackend.insert_dataset()` forwards tags to publishers

The v0.3.3b1 release was published (git tag exists).

## Decision

**CLOSE + ARCHIVE** -- Branch merged, feature shipped in v0.3.3b1. Historical merge tracking issue.
