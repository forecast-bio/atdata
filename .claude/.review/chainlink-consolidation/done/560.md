# Issue #560: Update all imports across tests, benchmarks, and src

**Priority:** medium
**Parent:** #557
**Status:** open -> CLOSED
**Created:** 2026-02-02
**Blocked by:** #559

## History

Sub-issue of #557. After the local/ -> index/ + stores/ reorganization (#559), all imports needed to be updated across the codebase.

## Current State Assessment

Imports have been updated throughout the codebase. The backward-compat shim in `src/atdata/local/__init__.py` ensures that any remaining imports from `atdata.local` still work, but the canonical import paths now use `atdata.index` and `atdata.stores`. The blocker (#559) was completed first.

## Decision

**CLOSE** -- Imports updated across the codebase, with backward-compat shim as safety net.
