# Issue #552: Implement notes from human feedback for 0.3

**Priority:** medium
**Status:** open -> CLOSED + ARCHIVED
**Created:** 2026-02-02

## History

This issue tracked implementation of human feedback notes received during the v0.3 development cycle.

## Current State Assessment

The project is now at v0.4.1b1, having gone through v0.3.0b1 through v0.3.4b1 and then v0.4.0b1 through v0.4.1b1. The specific feedback items from v0.3 were addressed through many subsequent issues:

- #553 addressed API refactors (lexicons, schema rename, module reorg)
- #575 addressed DX improvements from docs review
- Multiple release cycles incorporated the feedback iteratively

The original v0.3 feedback context is now stale and superseded by the substantial work done across 10+ releases since then.

## Decision

**CLOSE + ARCHIVE** -- Superseded. The v0.3 feedback has been addressed through subsequent issues and multiple release cycles. We are now 10+ versions ahead at v0.4.1b1.
