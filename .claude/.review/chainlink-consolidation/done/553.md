# Issue #553: v0.3 API refactors: lexicons, schema rename, module reorg, atmosphere streamlining

**Priority:** high
**Status:** open -> CLOSED
**Created:** 2026-02-02

## History

Parent issue tracking four v0.3 API refactoring tasks:

- #554 [closed] -- Rename AtmosphereClient -> Atmosphere + add login classmethod
- #555 [closed] -- Rename sampleSchema -> schema (clean break)
- #556 [closed] -- Finalize and place lexicons in src/atdata/lexicons/
- #557 [open] -- Rename atdata local CLI -> atdata infra + reorganize local/ module

## Current State Assessment

All four sub-issues are complete:

1. **#554**: `Atmosphere` class exists in `atmosphere/client.py` with `login()` classmethod.
2. **#555**: Schema field is now just `schema` in the lexicon types.
3. **#556**: Lexicons are in `src/atdata/lexicons/` and `justfile` has a `sync-lexicons` recipe.
4. **#557**: CLI uses `atdata infra` (not `atdata local`), and `local/` has been reorganized to `index/` + `stores/` with backward-compat shim.

## Decision

**CLOSE** -- All four sub-issues are complete. The v0.3 API refactoring is done.
