# Issue #204: Implement dataset operations live tests

## Verdict: CLOSE

## Evidence
Dataset operations are covered by two test classes in `test_atproto_live.py` plus dedicated S3 tests in `test_s3_live.py`. `TestDatasetPublishing` verifies publishing a dataset record with external URLs via `DatasetPublisher.publish_with_urls()` and retrieving it with `DatasetLoader.get()`. `TestBlobRoundTrip` performs a full end-to-end workflow: write samples to an in-memory tar, publish schema + dataset with blob storage via `publish_with_blobs()`, verify storage type is "blobs", retrieve blob URLs, load the dataset with `to_dataset()`, and iterate to verify sample data integrity. S3 live tests in `test_s3_live.py` (217 lines) cover shard writes (basic samples, array samples, cache_local, maxcount splitting), URL resolution (s3:// to https:// conversion), Index round-trip (write + read via Index with S3DataStore), and manifest generation.
