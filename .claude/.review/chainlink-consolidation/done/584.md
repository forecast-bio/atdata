# Issue #584: Fix docs generation errors

**Priority:** high
**Status:** open -> CLOSED + ARCHIVED
**Created:** 2026-02-03

## History

This issue tracked errors encountered during docs generation, likely during the initial quartodoc setup and configuration in the v0.3 era.

## Current State Assessment

The docs generation pipeline is now working:

- quartodoc v0.11.1+ is configured in `pyproject.toml`
- `docs_src/_quarto.yml` has a comprehensive configuration with proper sections
- The `justfile` `docs` recipe runs `quartodoc build` + `quarto render` with correct `QUARTO_PYTHON` setup
- The v0.3-era errors have been resolved through subsequent iterations

Any docs generation issues that exist now would be new bugs, not the original errors this issue tracked.

## Decision

**CLOSE + ARCHIVE** -- The original v0.3-era docs generation errors have been resolved. The pipeline is functional. Any new issues should be tracked as new bugs.
