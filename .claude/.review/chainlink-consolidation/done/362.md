# Issue #362: Plan auto-generated API docs from docstrings

**Priority:** high
**Status:** open -> CLOSED
**Created:** 2026-01-23

## History

This issue was created to plan auto-generated API documentation from Python docstrings. A research comment from 2026-01-23 recommended **quartodoc** as the tool of choice, citing its Quarto integration, griffe-based static analysis, and native sidebar generation.

## Current State Assessment

The work is fully complete:

- `docs_src/_quarto.yml` has a comprehensive quartodoc configuration with Google-style parser (`parser: google`), pkgdown style, and sections covering Core, Protocols, Data Sources, Local Storage, Atmosphere, and Promotion.
- `pyproject.toml` includes `quartodoc>=0.11.1` as a dependency.
- The `justfile` has a `docs` recipe that runs `quartodoc build` followed by `quarto render`, with proper `QUARTO_PYTHON` environment variable setup.
- The API reference is accessible at `api/index.qmd` in the navbar.

## Decision

**CLOSE** -- All work is done. quartodoc is fully integrated with the project's documentation pipeline.
