# Issue #369: Update CLAUDE.md with docstring formatting guidelines

**Priority:** medium
**Parent:** #363
**Status:** open -> CLOSED
**Created:** 2026-01-23

## History

Sub-issue of #363, specifically for documenting the docstring formatting conventions in CLAUDE.md so that future contributors (human or AI) follow the correct pattern.

## Current State Assessment

CLAUDE.md has a comprehensive "Docstring Formatting" section (starting at line 292) that covers:

- Google-style docstrings with quartodoc
- The `Examples:` (plural) convention with reasoning
- Correct vs incorrect format comparison
- Indentation rules (8 spaces for code, 4 more than the `Examples:` header)
- Multiple examples in the same section
- Class and method docstring formats

## Decision

**CLOSE** -- The guidelines are thoroughly documented in CLAUDE.md.
