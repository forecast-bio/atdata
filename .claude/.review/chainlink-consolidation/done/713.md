# Issue #713: Create .github/workflows/integration.yml workflow

**Priority:** medium
**Parent:** #705
**Status:** open -> CLOSED
**Created:** 2026-02-04

## History

Sub-issue of #705. Tracked creation of the GitHub Actions workflow file for running integration tests.

## Current State Assessment

`.github/workflows/integration.yml` exists with full configuration:

- **Triggers**: push to main/develop, PRs to main, nightly cron at 06:00 UTC, manual workflow_dispatch
- **Concurrency**: Groups by ref with cancel-in-progress
- **Services**: PostgreSQL 16 (port 5432) and Redis 7 (port 6379) with health checks
- **MinIO**: Started via `docker run` with health check loop (up to 30 seconds)
- **Environment variables**: ATProto test handle/password from GitHub secrets, MinIO/Postgres/Redis connection strings
- **Test execution**: `uv run pytest -m integration -v` with overridden addopts to drop default exclusion filter
- **Artifacts**: JUnit XML results uploaded with 30-day retention

## Decision

**CLOSE** -- Workflow file exists and is comprehensive.
