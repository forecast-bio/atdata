# Issue #203: Implement schema operations live tests

## Verdict: CLOSE

## Evidence
`TestSchemaPublishing` class in `tests/integration/test_atproto_live.py` implements 2 schema operation tests against the live PDS. `test_publish_and_get_schema` publishes a sample type via `SchemaPublisher`, retrieves it with `SchemaLoader.get()`, and verifies the version, property names, and property types match. `test_schema_with_ndarray_field` publishes a sample type with an NDArray field, retrieves the schema, and verifies the NDArray `$ref` is present in the properties. Both tests clean up created records after verification.
