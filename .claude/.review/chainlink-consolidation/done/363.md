# Issue #363: Fix Google docstring Example sections formatting across codebase

**Priority:** high
**Status:** open -> CLOSED
**Created:** 2026-01-23

## History

This issue tracked a codebase-wide fix for docstring Example sections. The comment noted 57 `Example:` sections needed to be changed from singular `Example:\n    ::` with 8-space indented code blocks to the correct `Examples:` (plural) format recognized by griffe's Google docstring parser.

Sub-issues:
- #364 [archived] -- dataset.py docstrings
- #365 [archived] -- lens.py docstrings
- #366 [archived] -- _protocols.py docstrings
- #367 [archived] -- local.py docstrings
- #368 [open] -- atmosphere module docstrings (also being closed)
- #369 [open] -- CLAUDE.md formatting guidelines (also being closed)

## Current State Assessment

All work is complete:

- grep across the entire `src/atdata/atmosphere/` directory shows 20 correctly formatted `Examples:` (plural) sections and zero instances of the incorrect singular `Example:` pattern.
- CLAUDE.md has a comprehensive "Docstring Formatting" section starting at line 292.
- Sub-issues #364-#367 were already archived as complete; #368 and #369 are being closed in this same audit.

## Decision

**CLOSE** -- The formatting fix has been applied across the entire codebase and documented in CLAUDE.md.
