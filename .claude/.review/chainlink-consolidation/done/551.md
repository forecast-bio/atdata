# Issue #551: Add automatic Claude permission hooks

**Priority:** medium
**Status:** open -> CLOSED + ARCHIVED
**Created:** 2026-02-02

## History

This issue was about automating the handling of Claude Code's trust/permission prompts that block background agents launched via `/kickoff`. Background agents would get stuck waiting for approval.

## Current State Assessment

This is a tooling/workflow concern, not a code change. The workaround is documented in `~/.claude/projects/.../MEMORY.md`:

> Background agents often get stuck on Claude Code's trust/permission prompts -- need to `tmux send-keys Enter` to approve

This is an operational procedure, not something that can be solved with code changes in the atdata repository. Any solution would need to come from Claude Code's configuration or the kickoff workflow tooling.

## Decision

**CLOSE + ARCHIVE** -- Not a codebase issue. Workflow workaround is documented in MEMORY.md. No code changes needed or possible within this repository.
