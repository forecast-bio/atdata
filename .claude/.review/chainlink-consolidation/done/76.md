# Issue #76: Validate and refine record Lexicon design

## Verdict: CLOSE

## Evidence
All 6 sub-issues (#77-#82) are archived. The issue comments document a grade upgrade from B+ to A- (production-ready). All three critical fixes were applied: `format: at-uri` added to the `schemaRef` field, storage types extracted to separate lexicons with proper ATProto discriminators (`storageBlobs`, `storageExternal`, `storageHttp`, `storageS3`), and blob array type usage verified as acceptable. All three high-priority fixes were applied: license field aligned to maxLength 200 with SPDX guidance, tags field aligned to 150-char items with 30 max tags, and metadata pattern documented (blob for extended data, top-level for searchable fields).
