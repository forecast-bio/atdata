# Issue #697: Live integration tests against remote service sandboxes (GH#21)

**Priority:** medium
**Status:** open -> CLOSED + ARCHIVED
**Created:** 2026-02-04

## History

Tracked as GitHub issue #21. Requested live integration tests against remote services (ATProto, S3/MinIO, PostgreSQL, Redis).

This is a duplicate of #705 which broke the work into sub-issues and was used as the primary tracking issue.

## Current State Assessment

Integration tests are fully implemented:

- `tests/integration/` directory exists with test modules
- Integration marker configured in `pyproject.toml` to exclude from default test runs
- `.github/workflows/integration.yml` runs tests against Postgres, Redis, MinIO, and ATProto sandbox
- Tests run on push to main/develop, PRs to main, and nightly at 06:00 UTC

## Decision

**CLOSE + ARCHIVE** -- Duplicate of #705. All work completed under that issue.
