---

These examples are self-contained demonstrations of atdata's key features.
Each one builds a working pipeline from scratch so you can see real code
paths end-to-end.

| Example | What It Shows |
|---------|--------------|
| [Typed Dataset Pipeline](typed-pipeline.qmd) | Define a sample type, write shards, iterate with batching |
| [Lens Transformations](lens-transforms.qmd) | View datasets through different schemas without copying data |
| [Manifest-Powered Queries](manifest-queries.qmd) | Build per-shard manifests and query samples by metadata |
| [Index-Managed Datasets](index-workflow.qmd) | Use `Index` with `LocalDiskStore` for managed dataset storage |
| [Multi-Split Datasets](multi-split.qmd) | Work with train/test splits via `DatasetDict` and `load_dataset` |

Start with the [Quick Start tutorial](../tutorials/quickstart.qmd) for foundational
concepts, then come back here for deeper worked examples.
