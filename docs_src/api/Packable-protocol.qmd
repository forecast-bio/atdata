# Packable { #atdata.Packable }

```python
Packable()
```

Structural protocol for packable sample types.

This protocol allows classes decorated with ``@packable`` to be recognized
as valid types for lens transformations and schema operations, even though
the decorator doesn't change the class's nominal type at static analysis time.

Both ``PackableSample`` subclasses and ``@packable``-decorated classes
satisfy this protocol structurally.

The protocol captures the full interface needed for:
- Lens type transformations (as_wds, from_data)
- Schema publishing (class introspection via dataclass fields)
- Serialization/deserialization (packed, from_bytes)

## Examples {.doc-section .doc-section-examples}

```python
>>> @packable
... class MySample:
...     name: str
...     value: int
...
>>> def process(sample_type: Type[Packable]) -> None:
...     # Type checker knows sample_type has from_bytes, packed, etc.
...     instance = sample_type.from_bytes(data)
...     print(instance.packed)
```
