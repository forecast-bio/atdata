# local.S3DataStore { #atdata.local.S3DataStore }

```python
local.S3DataStore(credentials, *, bucket)
```

S3-compatible data store implementing AbstractDataStore protocol.

Handles writing dataset shards to S3-compatible object storage and
resolving URLs for reading.

Attributes:
    credentials: S3 credentials dictionary.
    bucket: Target bucket name.
    _fs: S3FileSystem instance.

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [read_url](#atdata.local.S3DataStore.read_url) | Resolve an S3 URL for reading/streaming. |
| [supports_streaming](#atdata.local.S3DataStore.supports_streaming) | S3 supports streaming reads. |
| [write_shards](#atdata.local.S3DataStore.write_shards) | Write dataset shards to S3. |

### read_url { #atdata.local.S3DataStore.read_url }

```python
local.S3DataStore.read_url(url)
```

Resolve an S3 URL for reading/streaming.

For S3-compatible stores with custom endpoints (like Cloudflare R2,
MinIO, etc.), converts s3:// URLs to HTTPS URLs that WebDataset can
stream directly.

For standard AWS S3 (no custom endpoint), URLs are returned unchanged
since WebDataset's built-in s3fs integration handles them.

Args:
    url: S3 URL to resolve (e.g., 's3://bucket/path/file.tar').

Returns:
    HTTPS URL if custom endpoint is configured, otherwise unchanged.
    Example: 's3://bucket/path' -> 'https://endpoint.com/bucket/path'

### supports_streaming { #atdata.local.S3DataStore.supports_streaming }

```python
local.S3DataStore.supports_streaming()
```

S3 supports streaming reads.

Returns:
    True.

### write_shards { #atdata.local.S3DataStore.write_shards }

```python
local.S3DataStore.write_shards(ds, *, prefix, cache_local=False, **kwargs)
```

Write dataset shards to S3.

Args:
    ds: The Dataset to write.
    prefix: Path prefix within bucket (e.g., 'datasets/mnist/v1').
    cache_local: If True, write locally first then copy to S3.
    **kwargs: Additional args passed to wds.ShardWriter (e.g., maxcount).

Returns:
    List of S3 URLs for the written shards.

Raises:
    RuntimeError: If no shards were written.
