# packable { #atdata.packable }

```python
packable(cls)
```

Decorator to convert a regular class into a ``PackableSample``.

This decorator transforms a class into a dataclass that inherits from
``PackableSample``, enabling automatic msgpack serialization/deserialization
with special handling for NDArray fields.

The resulting class satisfies the ``Packable`` protocol, making it compatible
with all atdata APIs that accept packable types (e.g., ``publish_schema``,
lens transformations, etc.).

Args:
    cls: The class to convert. Should have type annotations for its fields.

Returns:
    A new dataclass that inherits from ``PackableSample`` with the same
    name and annotations as the original class. The class satisfies the
    ``Packable`` protocol and can be used with ``Type[Packable]`` signatures.

Example:
    >>> @packable
    ... class MyData:
    ...     name: str
    ...     values: NDArray
    ...
    >>> sample = MyData(name="test", values=np.array([1, 2, 3]))
    >>> bytes_data = sample.packed
    >>> restored = MyData.from_bytes(bytes_data)
    >>>
    >>> # Works with Packable-typed APIs
    >>> index.publish_schema(MyData, version="1.0.0")  # Type-safe
