Publishes PackableSample schemas to ATProto.

This class introspects a PackableSample class to extract its field
definitions and publishes them as an ATProto schema record.

Example:
    >>> @atdata.packable
    ... class MySample:
    ...     image: NDArray
    ...     label: str
    ...
    >>> client = AtmosphereClient()
    >>> client.login("handle", "password")
    >>>
    >>> publisher = SchemaPublisher(client)
    >>> uri = publisher.publish(MySample, version="1.0.0")
    >>> print(uri)
