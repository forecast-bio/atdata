# SampleBatch { #atdata.SampleBatch }

```python
SampleBatch(samples)
```

A batch of samples with automatic attribute aggregation.

This class wraps a sequence of samples and provides magic ``__getattr__``
access to aggregate sample attributes. When you access an attribute that
exists on the sample type, it automatically aggregates values across all
samples in the batch.

NDArray fields are stacked into a numpy array with a batch dimension.
Other fields are aggregated into a list.

Type Parameters:
    DT: The sample type, must derive from ``PackableSample``.

Attributes:
    samples: The list of sample instances in this batch.

Example:
    >>> batch = SampleBatch[MyData]([sample1, sample2, sample3])
    >>> batch.embeddings  # Returns stacked numpy array of shape (3, ...)
    >>> batch.names  # Returns list of names

Note:
    This class uses Python's ``__orig_class__`` mechanism to extract the
    type parameter at runtime. Instances must be created using the
    subscripted syntax ``SampleBatch[MyType](samples)`` rather than
    calling the constructor directly with an unsubscripted class.
